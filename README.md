# Text Formatter

This module provides an additional formatter to render values in all
core fields as HTML or comma-separated lists.

For multi-value fields, each field value becomes a list item. For long text
fields, each line becomes a list item.

Text Formatter also provides hooks (see textformatter.api.php) so that other
modules can register and implement listings for their field data. The
textformatter_contrib module provides some implementations. This is bundled
with this module. Currently entityreference, node reference, and link fields
are supported.
